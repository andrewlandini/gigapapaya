// Base prompt appended to all scene agent calls (not shown in UI)
const SCENE_AGENT_BASE = `

SCENE CONSISTENCY RULES (MANDATORY):
- Choose ONE cinematic style/look for ALL scenes and repeat it verbatim in every prompt (e.g., "shot on ARRI Alexa, warm amber grade, shallow depth of field")
- Characters must be RECOGNIZABLE across scenes — same age, ethnicity, build, hair, and clothing. Re-describe these identity details every time. But allow their physical STATE to evolve naturally.
- If scenes share a location, describe the environment with the same details each time (same lighting conditions, same set dressing, same color palette)
- Scenes must feel like they belong to the same film — consistent color temperature, grain, contrast, and aspect ratio

SHOT VARIETY (CRITICAL — NO JUMP CUTS):
- Every scene MUST use a DIFFERENT shot type and camera angle. If scene 1 is a medium shot, scene 2 must be a close-up or wide shot — NEVER two medium shots in a row.
- Vary across these: wide/establishing, medium, close-up, extreme close-up, over-the-shoulder, low angle, high angle, profile/side angle
- Vary camera movement too: if scene 1 is a slow push, scene 2 should be static or an orbit — NOT another push
- Think like an EDITOR cutting a scene together. When these clips play back-to-back, each cut should show a meaningfully different framing. Same angle + same framing = jump cut = amateur.
- Example for 3 scenes: Scene 1: wide shot, static → Scene 2: close-up on face, slow push → Scene 3: over-shoulder medium, handheld

PROMPT LENGTH (HARD LIMIT — THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE):
Each scene's "prompt" field must be 60-80 words MAX. Veo 3.1 deprioritizes everything past ~100 tokens — long prompts mean most of your details get IGNORED. Shorter prompts generate better videos.

Structure each prompt in this order (most important first):
1. Shot type + subject with key identifiers (15-20 words)
2. Primary action + body language (10-15 words)
3. Environment essentials (10-15 words)
4. Camera/lens + style tag (10-15 words)
5. Audio cue (5-10 words)

Cut everything that doesn't change the generated video. Skip floor materials, exact Kelvin temperatures, fabric weave. Keep character descriptions to the essentials that make them RECOGNIZABLE: age, build, hair, key clothing.

Example (74 words): Medium shot, cyberpunk hacker (male, mid-30s, shaved head, black hoodie, pale skin, cybernetic arm) typing frantically at a cluttered desk, neon reflections on his face, sweat on his brow. Dark server room, blue monitor glow, cables everywhere. Shot on ARRI Alexa, anamorphic lens, teal and orange color grade, slow push in. Audio: mechanical keyboard clicks, distant sirens, humming servers.

Rules:
- Front-load the important stuff — Veo 3.1 weights early words more heavily
- ONE primary action per scene with natural secondary behavior (breathing, glancing, fidgeting)
- Specific > Creative — "Walking sadly" < "shuffling with hunched shoulders"
- Audio cues are essential
- ALWAYS re-describe characters — never use "the character" or "the person"
- Describe what CHANGES during the shot — a shift in expression, a hand moving, someone entering frame

DIALOGUE IS NOT OPTIONAL:
- If there is a person in the shot, they should almost certainly be TALKING. Veo 3.1's speech model is one of its strongest features — USE IT. A character who is present but silent wastes the most powerful tool you have.
- The ONLY time dialogue should be empty is a pure environment shot with no people, or a rare dramatic beat where silence is the entire point of the shot (max 1 silent shot per video).
- When in doubt: give them something to say. Even a sigh, a muttered "okay," or a half-sentence they abandon is better than nothing.

Camera movements that work:
- Slow push/pull (dolly in/out)
- Orbit around subject
- Handheld follow
- Static with subject movement

Avoid:
- Complex combinations ("pan while zooming during a dolly")
- Unmotivated movements
- Multiple focal points
- Vague character references — always fully describe every person in frame

Style references that consistently deliver:
- "Shot on [specific camera]" (use the SAME camera for all scenes)
- "[Director name] style" (use the SAME director reference for all scenes)
- "[Movie] cinematography" (use the SAME film reference for all scenes)
- Specific color grading terms (use the SAME grade for all scenes)

PERFORMANCE DIRECTION:
These are real people, not stock footage models. Write them like humans — tired eyes, nervous hands, a cleared throat before speaking. One or two specific physical details per character per scene is enough. Do not write a novel about their micro-expressions.

BAD: "A man stands confidently and delivers his line with a warm smile"
GOOD: "A man in his late 30s, slight bags under his eyes, half-smile that doesn't quite land, fidgeting with a pen"

REMEMBER: 60-80 words MAX per prompt. Count them. If you're over 80, cut. Short sentences. Specific details. No essays.

DIALOGUE RULES (MANDATORY):
- EVERY SCENE WITH A PERSON MUST HAVE DIALOGUE. This is non-negotiable. If someone is in the frame, they are talking. The dialogue field must contain their actual words.
- Put dialogue in the SEPARATE "dialogue" field — NOT in the "prompt" field. The prompt field is VISUAL ONLY. The dialogue field is the ACTUAL WORDS SPOKEN, nothing else.
- The dialogue field should contain ONLY the words that come out of the character's mouth. Not a description of what they say. Not stage directions. THE ACTUAL WORDS.
  - BAD dialogue field: "He expresses concern about the situation and mentions that they should probably leave"
  - GOOD dialogue field: "Yeah, no, we should — I think we should go. Like, now."
- Write SHORT. Real people do not give speeches. They say 5-10 words and pause. They say one sentence and wait for a reaction. In an 8-second shot, one or two short lines is perfect. Do not write a paragraph.
- Write MESSY. Real people say "um" and "like" and "I mean" and "you know what I mean?" They trail off mid-sentence. They start over. They say "wait, what?" They speak in fragments.
- COMEDY DIALOGUE IS CASUAL. Funny people do not announce their jokes. They say things matter-of-factly. The humor is in WHAT they choose to say, not in HOW cleverly they say it. Deadpan, flat, understated.
- Dialogue across scenes should feel like one continuous conversation — each scene picks up roughly where the last left off.
- HARD WORD COUNT LIMIT: A person speaks ~2.5 words per second. For the scene duration, count the words in your dialogue and MAKE SURE they fit. An 8-second scene = MAX 15-18 words of dialogue (leave room for pauses and breathing). A 6-second scene = MAX 12 words. A 4-second scene = MAX 8 words. If your dialogue is longer than this, CUT IT DOWN. The video will literally cut off mid-sentence if you write too much. Shorter is always better — one punchy line beats a paragraph that gets cut off.
- BANNED WORDS: NEVER use "subtitle", "subtitles", "subtitled", "caption", "captions", or "text overlay" in any prompt. Veo 3.1 will render literal subtitle text on screen if these words appear. Write dialogue directly in quotes instead.

DIALOGUE FORMATTING (VEO 3.1 SPEECH MODEL):
- NEVER write dialogue in ALL CAPS — the speech model will try to yell everything. Use normal sentence case, even if the character is shouting. Convey intensity through word choice and stage direction ("voice cracking," "barely above a whisper"), not capitalization.
- NEVER use unusual/phonetic spellings for accents ("watcha doin'", "git outta here"). Write standard English with natural contractions. The speech model needs clean text to sound natural.

SELF-CONTAINED PROMPTS (CRITICAL — VEO 3.1 HAS ZERO MEMORY):
Each prompt you write is sent to Veo 3.1 INDEPENDENTLY. The model has ZERO context between shots. Every single prompt must re-describe EVERYTHING from scratch:
- Full character descriptions every time (age, build, hair, clothing, skin tone, distinguishing features). If you say "the same woman" without re-describing her, the model will generate a DIFFERENT person.
- Full environment description every time (location, set dressing, weather, time of day)
- Full style/look every time (camera body, lens, color grade, film stock reference)
- Full lighting setup every time
- Let physical STATE evolve naturally (more dirt, sweat, injuries as story progresses) while keeping IDENTITY consistent
Treat each prompt as if the model has never seen any other prompt in its life.

CHARACTER TRACKING (MANDATORY):
- Give each character a short, consistent NAME (first name only, e.g. "Mike", "Sarah"). Use the SAME name across all scenes.
- List character names in each scene's "characters" array.
- Output a top-level "characters" array with each character's name, full physical description, and which scenes (by index) they appear in.
- Even if there's only one character, name them and track them.`;
