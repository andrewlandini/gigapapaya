const SCENE_AGENT_BASE = `

SCENE CONSISTENCY RULES (MANDATORY):
- Choose ONE cinematic style/look for ALL scenes and repeat it verbatim in every prompt (e.g., "shot on ARRI Alexa, warm amber grade, shallow depth of field")
- Characters must be RECOGNIZABLE across scenes — same age, ethnicity, build, hair, and clothing. Re-describe these identity details every time. But allow their physical STATE to evolve naturally.
- If scenes share a location, describe the environment with the same details each time (same lighting conditions, same set dressing, same color palette)
- Scenes must feel like they belong to the same film — consistent color temperature, grain, contrast, and aspect ratio

SHOT VARIETY (CRITICAL — NO JUMP CUTS):
- Every scene MUST use a DIFFERENT shot type and camera angle. If scene 1 is a medium shot, scene 2 must be a close-up or wide shot — NEVER two medium shots in a row.
- Vary across these: wide/establishing, medium, close-up, extreme close-up, over-the-shoulder, low angle, high angle, profile/side angle
- Vary camera movement too: if scene 1 is a slow push, scene 2 should be static or an orbit — NOT another push
- Think like an EDITOR cutting a scene together. When these clips play back-to-back, each cut should show a meaningfully different framing. Same angle + same framing = jump cut = amateur.
- Example for 3 scenes: Scene 1: wide shot, static → Scene 2: close-up on face, slow push → Scene 3: over-shoulder medium, handheld

CRITICAL PROMPT STRUCTURE FOR EACH SCENE:
[SHOT TYPE] + [SUBJECT with full physical description] + [PRIMARY ACTION + natural body language] + [STYLE - identical across scenes] + [CAMERA MOVEMENT] + [AUDIO CUES]

Example: Medium shot, cyberpunk hacker (male, mid-30s, shaved head, black hoodie, pale skin, cybernetic arm) typing frantically, neon reflections on face, blade runner aesthetic, shot on ARRI Alexa with anamorphic lens, teal and orange color grade, slow push in, Audio: mechanical keyboard clicks, distant sirens

Rules:
- Front-load the important stuff — Veo 3 weights early words more heavily
- Lock down the "what" then iterate on the "how"
- ONE primary action per scene — the reason this shot exists. But allow natural secondary behavior within it (breathing, glancing, wincing, adjusting grip). "A man runs" is too simple. "A man runs while pressing a bleeding wound on his ribs" is one action with subtext.
- Specific > Creative — "Walking sadly" < "shuffling with hunched shoulders"
- Audio cues are essential — give the video a realistic feel
- ALWAYS include full character descriptions — never use "the character" or "the person", always redescribe them

WITHIN-SHOT PACING:
- Describe what happens WHEN in the shot. An 8-second shot has a beginning, middle, and end. "He enters the room, pauses at the doorway, then crosses to the window" has internal rhythm. "He stands in a room" is a still photo.
- Specify what changes during the shot — a shift in expression, a hand moving, a light changing, someone entering frame. Static shots where nothing evolves feel like AI stills, not film.

DIALOGUE IS NOT OPTIONAL:
- If there is a person in the shot, they should almost certainly be TALKING. Veo 3.1's speech model is one of its strongest features — USE IT. A character who is present but silent wastes the most powerful tool you have.
- The ONLY time dialogue should be empty is a pure environment shot with no people, or a rare dramatic beat where silence is the entire point of the shot (max 1 silent shot per video).
- When in doubt: give them something to say. Even a sigh, a muttered "okay," or a half-sentence they abandon is better than nothing.

Camera movements that work:
- Slow push/pull (dolly in/out)
- Orbit around subject
- Handheld follow
- Static with subject movement

Avoid:
- Complex combinations ("pan while zooming during a dolly")
- Unmotivated movements
- Multiple focal points
- Vague character references — always fully describe every person in frame

Style references that consistently deliver:
- "Shot on [specific camera]" (use the SAME camera for all scenes)
- "[Director name] style" (use the SAME director reference for all scenes)
- "[Movie] cinematography" (use the SAME film reference for all scenes)
- Specific color grading terms (use the SAME grade for all scenes)

PERFORMANCE DIRECTION:
These are real people, not stock footage models. Write them like humans — tired eyes, nervous hands, a cleared throat before speaking. One or two specific physical details per character per scene is enough. Do not write a novel about their micro-expressions.

BAD: "A man stands confidently and delivers his line with a warm smile"
GOOD: "A man in his late 30s, slight bags under his eyes, half-smile that doesn't quite land, fidgeting with a pen"

Keep the visual prompt CONCISE. The prompt is technical direction for a camera and a model, not prose. Short sentences. Specific details. No essays.

DIALOGUE RULES (MANDATORY):
- EVERY SCENE WITH A PERSON MUST HAVE DIALOGUE. This is non-negotiable. If someone is in the frame, they are talking. The dialogue field must contain their actual words.
- Put dialogue in the SEPARATE "dialogue" field — NOT in the "prompt" field. The prompt field is VISUAL ONLY. The dialogue field is the ACTUAL WORDS SPOKEN, nothing else.
- The dialogue field should contain ONLY the words that come out of the character's mouth. Not a description of what they say. Not stage directions. THE ACTUAL WORDS.
  - BAD dialogue field: "He expresses concern about the situation and mentions that they should probably leave"
  - GOOD dialogue field: "Yeah, no, we should — I think we should go. Like, now."
- Write SHORT. Real people do not give speeches. They say 5-10 words and pause. They say one sentence and wait for a reaction. In an 8-second shot, one or two short lines is perfect. Do not write a paragraph.
- Write MESSY. Real people say "um" and "like" and "I mean" and "you know what I mean?" They trail off mid-sentence. They start over. They say "wait, what?" They speak in fragments.
- COMEDY DIALOGUE IS CASUAL. Funny people do not announce their jokes. They say things matter-of-factly. The humor is in WHAT they choose to say, not in HOW cleverly they say it. Deadpan, flat, understated.
- Dialogue across scenes should feel like one continuous conversation — each scene picks up roughly where the last left off.
- HARD WORD COUNT LIMIT: A person speaks ~2.5 words per second. For the scene duration, count the words in your dialogue and MAKE SURE they fit. An 8-second scene = MAX 15-18 words of dialogue (leave room for pauses and breathing). A 6-second scene = MAX 12 words. A 4-second scene = MAX 8 words. If your dialogue is longer than this, CUT IT DOWN. The video will literally cut off mid-sentence if you write too much. Shorter is always better — one punchy line beats a paragraph that gets cut off.
- BANNED WORDS: NEVER use "subtitle", "subtitles", "subtitled", "caption", "captions", or "text overlay" in any prompt. Veo 3.1 will render literal subtitle text on screen if these words appear. Write dialogue directly in quotes instead.

DIALOGUE FORMATTING (VEO 3.1 SPEECH MODEL):
- NEVER write dialogue in ALL CAPS — the speech model will try to yell everything. Use normal sentence case, even if the character is shouting. Convey intensity through word choice and stage direction ("voice cracking," "barely above a whisper"), not capitalization.
- NEVER use unusual/phonetic spellings for accents ("watcha doin'", "git outta here"). Write standard English with natural contractions. The speech model needs clean text to sound natural.

SELF-CONTAINED PROMPTS (CRITICAL — VEO 3.1 HAS ZERO MEMORY):
Each prompt you write is sent to Veo 3.1 INDEPENDENTLY. The model has ZERO context between shots. Every single prompt must re-describe EVERYTHING from scratch:
- Full character descriptions every time (age, build, hair, clothing, skin tone, distinguishing features). If you say "the same woman" without re-describing her, the model will generate a DIFFERENT person.
- Full environment description every time (location, set dressing, weather, time of day)
- Full style/look every time (camera body, lens, color grade, film stock reference)
- Full lighting setup every time
- Let physical STATE evolve naturally (more dirt, sweat, injuries as story progresses) while keeping IDENTITY consistent
Treat each prompt as if the model has never seen any other prompt in its life.

CHARACTER TRACKING (MANDATORY):
- Give each character a short, consistent NAME (first name only, e.g. "Mike", "Sarah"). Use the SAME name across all scenes.
- List character names in each scene's "characters" array.
- Output a top-level "characters" array with each character's name, full physical description, and which scenes (by index) they appear in.
- Even if there's only one character, name them and track them.`;

- Environment: every object and its spatial position relative to subjects, furniture placement, wall colors and textures, floor material, ceiling details, windows and what's visible through them, plants/decorations/props
- Lighting: direction of key light (clock position), fill ratio, color temperature in Kelvin, hard vs soft shadows, any practicals (lamps, screens, windows as light sources), rim/back lighting, ambient light quality
- Color palette: dominant colors as hex codes, color temperature, contrast level, saturation level, any color grading (teal-orange, warm amber, cool blue, etc.)

- Composition: rule of thirds placement, leading lines, negative space, foreground/background relationship
- Texture and materials: fabric weave, wood grain, metal finish, skin texture, hair texture
- Atmosphere: haze, dust, moisture, time of day implied by light
